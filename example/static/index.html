<h1>Simple Example</h1>

<h3>Include of content</h3>
<div cx-url='{{server:local}}/include.html' cx-cache-key='shakespeare' cx-cache-ttl='10s' class='block'>
    This will be replaced with some shakespeare.
</div>

<h3>Dynamic content cached for 10s</h3>
<div cx-url='{{server:local}}/dynamic' cx-cache-key='dynamic' cx-cache-ttl='10s' class='block'>
    This will be replaced with some dynamic content that is cached if a cache is configured.
</div>

<h3>Service that fails</h3>
<div cx-url='{{server:local}}/500' cx-cache-key='error' cx-cache-ttl='10s' class='block'>
    This is a call to a service that will fail, the configuration does not have quietFail = true, so will tell you it has failed.
</div>

<h3>Service that is slow</h3>
<div cx-url='{{server:local}}/slow' cx-cache-key='error' cx-cache-ttl='10s' cx-timeout="50" class='block'>
    This is a call to a service that is slower than the timeout.
</div>
